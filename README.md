# Introduction

Galilel (GALI) is an open-source Proof-of-Stake digital cryptocurrency for fast
(using SwiftX), private (Zerocoin protocol) and secure microtransactions. Our
main goal is to create a decentralized fully secure and anonymous network to
run applications which do not rely on any central body control. By having a
distributed system, thousands of users will be responsible for maintaining the
application and data so that there is no single point of failure.

Galilel Cloud is a service hosting platform. It differentiates from other
masternode hosting platforms by its kind of automation. New masternode and
proof-of-stake coins can be added automatically to the platform by the coin
developer and paying the listing fee in GALI. New coins run in a sandbox mode
until they have been verified that no backdoors have been implemented to clear
wallets from other coins. Isolation of different users and their wallets are
managed via Linux Containers (LXC). Our customers get a fully automated
solution to run with simple clicks a fully managed masternode and staking
platform. Beside Masternode as a Service (MaaS) and Proof-of-Stake as a Service
(PoSaaS) we implement Block Explorer as a Service (BEaaS) to allow new coins
and their teams to focus on their important work while we deliver the block
explorer to their users.
